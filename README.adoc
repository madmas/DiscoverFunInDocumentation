= Fun in Documentation - Sample & Slides

This repository contains the slides and the sample for Asciidoctor shown during the talk https://www.ittage.informatik-aktuell.de/programm/2019/dokumentation-als-vergnuegen/["Dokumentation als Vergn√ºgen"] at https://www.ittage.informatik-aktuell.de/[IT Tage 2019]. 

There is also an earlier version from the talk at https://github.com/madmas/DiscoverFunInDocumentation/tree/DevoxxMA2019[Devoxx Morocco 2019].

For the https://doctoolchain.github.io/docToolchain/[docToolchain] and https://antora.org/[Antora] examples there is no code included as everything I showed was from the standard repository. Please have a look at their documentation and feel free to contact me if you encounter any questions!
