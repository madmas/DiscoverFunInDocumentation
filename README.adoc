= Fun in Documentation - Sample & Slides

This repository contains the slides and the sample for Asciidoctor shown during the talk https://cfp.devoxx.ma/2019/talk/KZK-9624/Discover_Fun_in_Documentation["Discover Fun in Documentation"] at https://www.devoxx.ma/[DevoxxMA 2019].

For the https://doctoolchain.github.io/docToolchain/[docToolchain] example there is no code included as everything I showed was from the standard repository. Please have a look at their documentation and feel free to contact me if you encounter any questions!
