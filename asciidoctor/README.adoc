= Asciidoctor Sample

Please note that this sample need to be run with *Gradle 5.0* or prior due to https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-gradle-plugin/issues/424[this bug] that will be fixed with the next release.

[NOTE]
Note that for the diagrams to be rendered, you need to have https://graphviz.org/[GraphViz] and https://github.com/mermaidjs/mermaid.cli[Mermaid.cli] installed. +
For the latter one, I also needed to add an alias so the AcsiiDoctor plugin would find the mermaid executable (alias mermaid=mmdc). +
For an CI build, I'd recommend to encapsulate these requirements in a container and/or self-contained build.
